## My Beginnings in Programming

In 2018, I entered high school and decided to get computer and digital sciences as an option. This introduction to programming was my first contact with the world of technology. There, I learned the basics of **Python** and **C**. We created small projects like mathematical representations and a simple game.

The following year I started creating small projects, such as a **Sudoku solver** and a **crypographic decoder**. I also learned about **algorithms**, **data structures** and **networks**.

## Deep Dive into the Low Levels

After high school, I enrolled in the **Saint-Étienne Initial IT Training Cycle (CITISE)** at **Télécom Saint-Étienne**, where I truly began to understand what lies beneath the user interfaces and high-level abstractions. This intensive preparatory program gave me a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computing and engineering.

### Theoretical Foundations

Throughout the program, I strengthened my understanding of the **mathematics** behind computer science. These concepts were deeply intertwined with the **physics** I studied which later helped me grasp the physical principles behind electronic components and signal processing.

### Electronics, Embedded Systems and Networks

One of the most important parts of CITISE was diving into **electronics**, **embedded programming** and **networks**. I learned how to work with **microcontrollers**, write low-level code in **C**, and manipulate sensors to build interactive systems.

## Becoming a DevOps Engineer

In 2022, I graduated from CITISE and joined **Polytech Montpellier** to pursue an **Engineering degree** with a specialization in **Development and Operations (DO)**. This 3-year program combines academic learning with real-world experience through an **apprenticeship**, allowing me to work in a company for half of my time while studying.

### Learning by Doing

The DO program is strongly project-based. From the start, I was immersed in teams, covering the entire **DevOps lifecycle**: from **design**, **development**, and **testing**, to **integration**, **deployment**, **monitoring**, **scaling**, and **evolution** of applications — both **on-premises** and in the **cloud**.

### Immersed in Industry

As an **apprentice**, I alternated between **two weeks in the company** and **two weeks at school**, applying what I learned in a real DevOps team. This rhythm helps me stay aligned with the evolving needs of the industry, taking part in both **short-term tasks** and **long-term strategic projects**.

### Professional Exposure and Events

Throughout the program, I had opportunities to attend conferences such as **KubeCon Europe** in London, as well as national tech events in **Paris**, **Montpellier** and beyond.

I also took part in **hackathons**.

## International Experience

In 2025, I had the incredible opportunity to work as an intern at **the University of Southern Denmark (SDU)**. This experience allowed me to immerse myself in a different culture, learn from a new team, and apply my skills in an international context. I worked on an **AI** focused project, where I collaborated with colleagues from diverse backgrounds, to develop a new LLM (Large Language Model) application that could be used to detect breast cancer from medical images and reports.

## Event Organization

In 2024–2025, I had the opportunity to **lead the organization of the PolyCloud Montpellier** as the **president of the student association** behind the event. It was an incredibly rewarding experience where I worked closely with my classmates to bring together students, professionals, and cloud computing enthusiasts for a full day of knowledge sharing and networking.

From the ground up, we planned the entire event — inviting speakers from various companies and universities, securing sponsors, and handling all logistical aspects. This experience allowed me to put my **project management and organizational skills** into practice while building meaningful connections within the tech and cloud ecosystem.
